<Goal>
Creating a backend to interact with the frontend, where the service is a web app that will present information in a dashboard suitable for startup ideas, to see what kind of barriers to entry or what type of market the startup is entering. There will also be an option to make a pitch deck that will use the same information used in the dashboard.
