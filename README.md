## 💭 Inspiration  

One of our teammates started a small cookie business in grade 10 but didn’t understand how pricing and market demand worked. They ended up selling cookies at a loss and realized how hard it is to start a business without proper guidance or market analysis.  

That valuable experience inspired us to create **JustAStartUp** — a tool that helps new founders understand their market and plan for sustainable growth.
